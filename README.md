# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Ms. Isualize would like an analysis performed on the total weekly fares by city type to determine how stakeholders can affect changes at Pyber.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_summary.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.7, conda 4.12.0, jupyter notebook 6.4.8, pandas 1.41, matplotlib 3.5.1, numpy 1.21.2

## Summary

## Challenge Summary
Analysis prior to nullifying 9th Grade Thomas High School scores:

Analysis after nullifying 9th Grade Thomas High School scores:

As evidenced by the above photos, upon invalidating the 9th grade scores from Thomas High school several passing percentages and average scores were lowered from the original analysis: overall passing percentage, math passing percentage, reading passing percentage, and average math score. Interestingly, average reading scores actually increased.

In the grand scheme of this analysis, the lowered scores and percentages show that the 9th graders at Thomas High School perhaps had a hand in raising overall results from Thomas High School. Additionally, the higher average reading score demonstrates that the 9th graders at Thomas were bringing down the rest of the school.

However, erasing scores completely does not give an accurate picture into the success rate at Thomas High School. This only serves to lower the school as a whole, as shown above. To add to that, this unfairly penalizes students that may have had no hand in any academic impropriety. I would suggest administering a retest, then using those results within this analysis to help better gauge how Thomas High School helps to prepare the future leaders of this world.
