# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Ms. Isualize would like an analysis performed on the total weekly fares by city type to determine how stakeholders can affect changes at Pyber.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_summary.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.7, conda 4.12.0, jupyter notebook 6.4.8, pandas 1.41, matplotlib 3.5.1, numpy 1.21.2

## Summary
![PyBer Fare Summary by City Type:](https://github.com/michael999999999/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

Upon analysis of the weekly PyBer fares, it is clear that most revenue comes from Urban riders. Earlier analysis would indicate this is most likely due to the volume of riders in Urban cities versus those in Suburban and Rural cities. Conversely, earlier analysis also showed that rides in Urban cities tend to cost less than those in Suburban and Rural cities.
